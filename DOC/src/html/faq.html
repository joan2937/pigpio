<p>If you think you have damaged one or more GPIO you can carry out
a diagnostic test.</p>
<p>The test is a command line script called <a rel="nofollow"
class="external text" href=
"http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/code/gpiotest.zip">gpiotest</a></p>
For the duration of the test nothing must be connected to the GPIO
(no LEDs, wires, ribbon cables etc.).
<p>The test checks that each GPIO may be read and written and that
the internal resistor pull-ups and pull-downs are functional.</p>

<h3><a name="How_do_I_debounce_inputs" id=
"How_do_I_debounce_inputs"></a>How do I debounce inputs?</h3>
<p>Some devices like mechanical switches can generate multiple
interrupts as they bounce between on and off.&nbsp; It is possible
to debounce the inputs in hardware by the correct use of resistors
and capacitors.<br></p>
<p>In software use the glitch filter which ignores all events
shorter than a set number of microseconds.&nbsp; C <a href=
"cif.html#gpioGlitchFilter">gpioGlitchFilter</a>, Python <a href=
"python.html#set_glitch_filter">set_glitch_filter</a>.<br></p>
<h3><a name="How_fast_is_SPI" id="How_fast_is_SPI"></a>How fast is
SPI?</h3>
The SPI throughput in samples per second depends on a number of
factors.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The SPI bit rate (transfer rate in bits per second)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The number of bytes transferred per sample (a 12 bit ADC sample
may require 3 bytes to transfer)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The driver used</li>
</ul>
<p>Two of those factors are fixed, the variable is the driver
used.</p>
<p>The pigpio driver is considerably faster than the Linux SPI
driver as is demonstrated by the following graphs.<br></p>
<p>Each graph shows the SPI bit rate in bits per second along the
horizontal axis.&nbsp; The samples per second achieved is shown on
the vertical axis.&nbsp; Each graph contains plots assuming 1 to 5
bytes per transfer.<br></p>
<p>The source code used for the tests is <a href=
"code/spi-driver-speed.c">spi-driver-speed.c</a> and <a href=
"code/spi-pigpio-speed.c">spi-pigpio-speed.c</a><br></p>

<h3><a name="Library_update_fails" id=

<p>pigpio places files in the following locations<br></p>
<p>/usr/local/include (pigpio.h, pigpiod_if.h, pigpiod_if2.h)<br>
/usr/local/lib (libpigpio.so, libpigpiod_if.so,
libpigpiod_if2.so)<br>
/usr/local/bin (pig2vcd, pigpiod, pigs)<br>

The raspberrypi.org image containing pigpio uses different
locations.<br>
<p>/usr/include (pigpio.h, pigpiod_if.h, pigpiod_if2.h)<br>
/usr/lib (libpigpio.so, libpigpiod_if.so, libpigpiod_if2.so)<br>
/usr/bin (pig2vcd, pigpiod, pigs)<br>
/usr/man (man pages)<br></p>
<p>Mostly this doesn't matter as the /usr/local directories will
generally be earlier in the search path.&nbsp; The pigpio built
includes, binaries, and manuals are normally found first.<br></p>
<p>However the wrong libraries may be linked during the
compilation.&nbsp; If this is the case remove the /usr/lib entries
for libpigpio.so , libpigpiod_if.so, and libpigpiod_if2.so</p>

<h3><a name="make_fails" id="make_fails"></a>make fails with clock
skew</h3>
<p>If make fails with one of the following messages it is probably
because the Pi's clock is wrong.<br></p>
<p><code>make: Warning: File 'xxx' has modification time x s in the
future<br>
make: warning: Clock skew detected. Your build may be
incomplete.</code></p>
<p>make uses the current time to work out which files need to be
rebuilt (a file is rebuilt if it depends on other files which have
a later time-stamp).<br></p>
<p>The solution is to make sure the system clock is correct.&nbsp;
If the Pi is networked this will not normally be a problem.<br></p>
<p>To set the date and time use the date command as in the
following example.</p>
<p><code>sudo date -d "2017-03-01 18:47:00"</code></p>
<h3><a name="Porting_pigpio" id="Porting_pigpio"></a>Porting pigpio
to another CPU/SoC</h3>
<h3><a name="Sound_isnt_working" id="Sound_isnt_working"></a>Sound
isn't working</h3>
<p>The Pi contains two pieces of hardware, a PWM peripheral and a
PCM peripheral, to generate sound.&nbsp; The PWM peripheral is
normally used and generates medium quality audio out of the
headphone jack.&nbsp; The PCM peripheral may be used by add-ons
such as HATs and generates high quality audio.<br></p>
<p>pigpio uses at least one of these peripherals during normal
operation (for timing DMA transfers).&nbsp; pigpio will use both
peripherals if waves or the hardware PWM function is used.<br></p>
<p>By default pigpio uses the PCM peripheral leaving the PWM
peripheral free for medium quality audio.<br></p>
<p>You can change the default with a configuration option.&nbsp;
For C use <a href="cif.html#gpioCfgClock">gpioCfgClock</a>, for the
<a href="pigpiod.html">pigpio daemon</a> use the -t option.</p>
<h3><a name="What_is_I2C" id="What_is_I2C"></a>What is I2C?</h3>
<p>I2C is a data link between the Pi (master) and one or more
slaves.</p>
<p>Data may be sent and received but the Pi initiates all
transfers.<br></p>
<p>I2C is a medium speed link.&nbsp; On the Pi the default speed is
100 kbps, but 400 kbps also works.<br></p>
<p>I2C is implemented as a bus with two lines called<br></p>
<ul>
<li>SDA - for data</li>
<li>SCL - for a clock</li>
</ul>
On the Pi bus 1 is used which uses GPIO 2 (pin 3) for SDA and GPIO
3 (pin 5) for SCL.<br>
<br>
Only one slave device may be communicated with at a time.&nbsp;
Each message from the Pi includes the slave to be addressed and
whether a read or write is to be performed.<br>
<br>
When the Pi (master) wishes to talk to a slave it begins by issuing
a start sequence on the I2C bus. A start sequence is one of two
special sequences defined for the I2C bus, the other being the stop
sequence. The start sequence and stop sequence are special in that
these are the only places where the SDA (data line) is allowed to
change while the SCL (clock line) is high. When data is being
transferred, SDA must remain stable and not change whilst SCL is
high. The start and stop sequences mark the beginning and end of a
transaction with the slave device.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 600px;" alt="I2C start and stop sequences" src=
"images/faq-i2c-ss.png"><br>
<br>
Data is transferred in 8-bit bytes. The bytes are placed on the SDA
line starting with the most significant bit. The SCL line is then
pulsed high, then low. For every byte transferred, the device
receiving the data sends back an acknowledge bit, so there are
actually 9 SCL clock pulses to transfer each 8-bit byte of data. If
the receiving device sends back a low ACK bit, then it has received
the data and is ready to accept another byte. If it sends back a
high then it is indicating it cannot accept any further data and
the master should terminate the transfer by sending a stop
sequence.<br>
<br>

"images/faq-i2c.jpg"><br></p>
<h3><a name="What_is_Serial" id="What_is_Serial"></a>What is
Serial?</h3>
<p>Serial is a data link between the Pi and one other
device.<br></p>
<p>Data may be sent and received.&nbsp; Either the Pi or the device
can initiate a transfer.<br></p>
<p>Serial is a low to medium speed link.&nbsp; On the Pi speeds of
50, 75, 110, 134, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600,
19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, and 230400 bps may be used.<br></p>
<p>Serial is implemented with one line for transmit called TXD and
one line for receive called RXD.<br></p>
<p>If only receive or transmit are required the other line need not
be connected.<br></p>
<p>The Pi uses GPIO 14 (pin 8) for TXD and GPIO 15 (pin 10) for
RXD.<br></p>
<p>Data is normally transmitted in 8-bit bytes with a start bit,
eight data bits, no parity, and one stop bit.&nbsp; This is
represented as 8N1.&nbsp; The number of transmitted bits per second
(bps) is called the baud rate.&nbsp;&nbsp; The time for each bit,
<span style="font-style: italic;">1 / baud rate</span> seconds, is
referred to as the bit period.<br></p>
<p>The lines are in the high state when no data is being
transmitted.&nbsp; The start of a byte is signalled by the line
going low for one bit period (the start bit).&nbsp; The data bits
are then sent least significant bit firsts (low if the bit is 0,
high if the bit is 1).&nbsp; The data bits are followed by the
optional parity bit.&nbsp; Finally the line is set high for at
least the number of stop bit periods.&nbsp; The line will stay high
if there are no more bytes to be transmitted.<br></p>

<h3><a name="What_is_SPI" id="What_is_SPI"></a>What is SPI?</h3>
<p>SPI is a data link between the Pi (master) and one or more
slaves.</p>
<p>Data may be sent and received but the Pi initiates all
transfers.<br></p>
<p>SPI is a medium to high speed link.&nbsp; On the Pi speeds of 32
kbps to 8 Mbps may be used.<br></p>
<p>SPI is implemented as a bus with three lines called<br></p>
<ul>
<li>MOSI - for data from the Pi to the slave</li>
<li>MISO - for data from the slave to the Pi</li>
<li>SCLK - for a clock</li>
</ul>
Only one slave device may be communicated with at a time.&nbsp; An
additional line per slave called slave select is used to identify
the slave to be addressed.
<p>The Pi has two SPI buses<br></p>

<li>the main SPI bus

<li>MOSI GPIO 10 (pin 19)</li>
