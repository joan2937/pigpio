<title>Pipe interface</title>
</head>
<body>
pigpio provides a pipe interface to many of its functions.<br>
<br>
The pipe interface is available whenever pigpio is running, either
because it has been started as a daemon, or it has been linked in
to a running user program.&nbsp; The pipe interface can be disabled
by the program which initialises the library.&nbsp; pigpiod offers
the -f option to disable the pipe interface.&nbsp; User programs
should call <a href=
"http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/cif.html#gpioCfgInterfaces">gpioCfgInterfaces</a>
if they wish to disable the pipe interface.<br>
<br>
pigpio listens for commands on pipe /dev/pigpio.&nbsp; The commands
consist of a command identifier with, depending on the command,
zero, one, or two parameters.&nbsp; The result, if any, may be read
from pipe /dev/pigout.&nbsp; If any errors are detected a message
will be written to pipe /dev/pigerr.<br>
<br>
<br>
The format of the commands is identical to those used by <a href=
