A program showing how to use the gpioSetGetSamplesFunc function to set a callback for accumulated gpio state changes over the last millisecond.

A frequency count is generated for each monitored gpio (frequencies up to 500KHz and beyond).

Generally the method used is more complicated but more efficient than frequency counter 1.
